Changes new in version 0.16.2, 29 November, 2006
========================================================================

- Fixed the parsers to use the user-supplied std::ostream consistently
  for error and warning output.

- Fixed the parser error and warning output to report line and column
  number information more consistently and accurately.

- Fixed the build system such that a failure to find all of GtkGLExt's
  prerequisites will not cause configure to fail.

- Fixed the build system to better accommodate a user-supplied antlr
  executable.


Changes new in version 0.16.1, 28 October, 2006
========================================================================

- Replaced the Mozilla plug-in's openvrml-player helper program with
  openvrml-gtkplug, a reusable out-of-process GTK+ VRML browser
  component.

- Removed use of XPCOM from the Mozilla plug-in.  This should allow
  the plug-in to work in any browser that supports NPAPI and XEmbed
  plug-ins.

- Added basic rendering of Text nodes on Windows.  Font selection
  remains unimplemented.

- Fixed problem where GtkGLExt was built even when not needed.

  implementations are loaded asynchronously.

- Support for constructing scene graphs from Classic VRML-encoded X3D,
  including the Core, Interchange, Interactive, MPEG4, Immersive, and
  Full profiles.

- Mozilla plug-in now uses the Web browser for resource fetching; so
  it gets the benefit of the Web browser's cache.


Changes new in version 0.15.10, 4 August, 2005
========================================================================

- Now compiles with gcc 4.0.1.

- Fixed problem compiling on FreeBSD.

========================================================================

- Fixed 64-bit cleanliness issue in the Mozilla plug-in.

- Fixed --disable-mozilla-plugin configure option.

- Replaced use of DejaGnu with GNU Autotest.


Changes new in version 0.15.6, 26 January, 2005
========================================================================

- Fixed build to more reliably find Mozilla headers.

- Fixed behavior of openvrml::find_interface function, which has the
  side effect of fixing a problem parsing a field "zzz" in a node that
  also has an eventIn "set_zzz" or an eventOut "zzz_changed".

- Fixed crash on malformed UTF-8 in the Text node.

- Fixed problem parsing rotation values.


Changes new in version 0.15.5, 10 January, 2005
========================================================================

- Mozilla plug-in is now out-of-process. This addresses the
  interactivity issues present in 0.15.4 and provides an overall more
  robust design for the plug-in.

- Fixed bugs in openvrml::browser::find_node and
  openvrml::node_traverser.

- Fixed a problem with the build system when configuring with
  --disable-script-node-javascript.

- Updated API documentation to use Doxygen 1.4.


Changes new in version 0.15.4, 29 December, 2004
========================================================================

- Refactored use of GtkGLExt in the Mozilla plug-in.

- Fixed a typo in a dependency of the openvrml-gl-devel RPM package.


Changes new in version 0.15.3, 25 December, 2004
========================================================================

========================================================================

- Made building the tests optional.

- Minor bug fixes.


Changes new in version 0.15.1, 27 November, 2004
========================================================================

- Fixed problems compiling with Microsoft Visual C++ 7.1.  This release
  really does compile with that compiler. Honest.


Changes new in version 0.15.0, 26 November, 2004
========================================================================

- lookat now uses SDL instead of GLUT and is licenced under the terms of
  the GPL.  (The OpenVRML libraries remain available under the terms of
  the LGPL.)

- OpenVRML now builds with Microsoft Visual C++ 7.1.

- Rearchitected event propagation to eliminate string comparisons.
  Event propagation is now much, much faster.

- Added a Mozilla plug-in (for platforms that use a GTK+ 2.x-based
  Mozilla browser).  In this release the plug-in is mostly a proof of
  concept which may not be usable for day-to-day browsing of VRML
  worlds.

- Eliminated use of regex (so Windows users no longer need the regex
  library.)

- Fixed too many bugs to mention here.


Changes new in version 0.14.3, 16 November, 2003

- OpenVRML now uses FreeType and Fontconfig for Text/FontStyle node
  support.

- VrmlScene has been replaced with Browser.

========================================================================

- Minor build fixes.


Changes new in version 0.12.0, 16 June, 2002
========================================================================

- Nodes have been completely rearchitected so as to abstract their
  implementations from the core library. Many bugs fixed in the
  process, and a few regressions introduced.

- Preliminary (incomplete) support for Java in the Script node.

- Added VrmlMatrix class.

- CylinderSensor is now supported.

- Viewpoints inside Transforms should work correctly now.

- Applied sanity to use of the garbage collector in the JavaScript
  binding.

- The core library can now be compiled without OpenGL/Mesa.

- OpenVRML now uses namespaces extensively.

- Now using pkg-config.

- Mostly-complete Doxygen documentation.


Changes new in version 0.11.2, 18 October, 2001
========================================================================

- Fixed some minor regressions since 0.10.1.

- `configure' now works for `--without-mozjs'.


Changes new in version 0.11.1, 5 August, 2001
========================================================================

- Fixes to the Visual C++ build.

- Other minor bugfixes.


Changes new in version 0.11.0, 30 July, 2001
========================================================================

- New memory manager for nodes, using a refcounted smart pointer instead of
  an intrusive reference count.

- Significant reworking of the JavaScript binding. More to come.

- Now (optionally) depends on the Mozilla distribution of JavaScript instead
  of compiling our own into the library.

- libpng and libjpeg are now optional dependencies.

========================================================================

- Changed library names from libvrml97 and libvrml97gl to libopenvrml
  and libopenvrml-gl, respectively.

- Changed header file installation locations.

- API cleanup: improved const-correctness many places and changed many
  of the VrmlField subclass methods to match the semantic used by the
  corresponding objects in the ECMAScript binding.

- JavaScript support restored to the default build.


Changes new in version 0.9.0, 7 December, 2000
========================================================================

- Name change: the library is now called OpenVRML.

- Project has moved to SourceForge:  <http://openvrml.sourceforge.net>

- Library is now covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

- New parser, removing the dependency on SGI parser code.
  (Braden McDaniel <braden@endoframe.com>)

- View frustum culling and navigation fixes.
  (Christopher K. St. John <cstjohn@acm.org>,
  S. K. Bose <bose@pavan.barc.ernet.in>)

- Can now compile under CygWin.
  (Jean-Daniel Fekete <Jean-Daniel.Fekete@emn.fr>)

  (Matt Giger <mgiger@lunarsoft.com>.)

- MPEG reader for MovieTexture nodes.
  (Chris Morley <cmorley@vermontel.net>)

- Updated the JavaScript support to use Mozilla JS 1.5rc2.
  (Braden McDaniel <braden@endoframe.com>)

- Lots of clean ups and fixes.

- Some significant regressions in this release, unfortunately.
  Architectural changes have left some parts of the library in a state
  of flux for this release, but enough progress has been made overall
  that we felt a release would be beneficial anyway.


Changes new in version 0.8.2, January 2000
========================================================================

- S. K. Bose <bose@pavan.barc.ernet.in> has revived the Win32 build.

- Braden McDaniel <braden@endoframe.com> backed out requirement for "namespace"
  support from the C++ compiler ... for now.


Changes new in version 0.8.1, December 1999
========================================================================

- LibVRML97 is now hosted on the Open VRML Advancement League (OVAL) CVS server.

- Braden McDaniel <braden@endoframe.com> and Christopher K. St. John
  <cstjohn@acm.org> reorganized the GNU build, and added the use of libtool.

- Braden McDaniel <braden@endoframe.com> moved xmlookat, gtklookat, win32lookat,
  and the lookat Netscape plug-in out of the LibVRML97 build and distribution to
  be placed in their own packages.

- Braden McDaniel <braden@endoframe.com> updated the JavaScript code with a
  snapshot from the mozilla.org CVS server.

- Michael Louka <Michael.Louka@hrp.no> enabled a Mac build. (Yea!)


Changes new in version 0.8.0 March X 1999 (Unreleased)
========================================================================

- Erik Andersen <andersee@debian.org> has revived the win32 build
  and fixed a bunch of portability problems. MSVC++5 project and
  workspace files are again included in the distribution, as well
  as the generated parser/lexer sources (so you don't need flex
  and bison to build anymore on most platforms).

- Steve Sycamore <sycamore@inr.net> wrote a netscape plugin.

- Kumaran Santhanam <rhapsody@stanford.edu> has contributed a sound
  driver (Sound and AudioClip nodes) for Linux/OSS. See README.SOUND.

- Erik Andersen <andersee@debian.org> wrote the gtklookat browser.

- S. K. Bose also worked on the win32 port and ported the javascript
  support to windows.

- Joe Longson added methods to retrieve scene geometry information
  from client applications.

- Some bug fixes, including a problem with negative TimeSensor 
  fraction_changed eventOuts, a crash when writing an error message
  about invalid node names in ROUTEs, and an empty CoordIndex lexer
  fix all submitted by Kumaran Santhanam <rhapsody@stanford.edu>, and a 
  Text/MFString problem found by Anton Eliens <eliens@computer.org>.

- Implemented PlaneSensor (USEd PlaneSensors will not behave correctly
  yet, though).

- The stubs for Java in Script nodes have been added (using the Sun
  JDK) but it is not worth enabling yet. Java/JNI hackers are welcome
  to jump in...

- I fixed DEF name scoping issues and re-did the PROTO/EXTERNPROTO 
  implementation so it is now robust and spec-conforming and just tried 
  to keep up with all the stuff being done by everyone else.

- The JavaScript support is more robust, including support for IS'd
  script fields.

- Lexer couldn't handle leading '+' on numbers.


Changes new in version 0.7.9 Nov 4 1998
========================================================================

- Erik Andersen <andersen@inconnect.com> contributed some code for a 
  GLP'd GTK viewer. It doesn't display anything yet, though, so it is
  not built by default.

- Gamma setting code for PNG images submitted by Greg Roelofs
  <newt@pobox.com>.

- Alpha/zlib porting changes submitted by Stuart Anderson 
  <anderson@metrolink.com>. At least zlib version 1.1.2 should be 
  used (or you may get undefined symbols gzopen,gzread,gzclose).

- Rewrote the texture handling in the OpenGL code to use OpenGL1.1
  glBindTexture() rather than putting textures in display lists.
  Mesa has been using the OpenGL 1.1 API since Mesa-2.0 and I don't
  know of any commercial OGLs still at 1.0. If this causes a problem
  let me know. On my system I see about a 15-25% speedup for textured 
  scenes with Mesa-3.0 (eg, orbit3.wrl). Background node panorama 
  URLs have also been sped up for some cases independent of the 
  bindTexture changes.

- IndexedFaceSets respect the "convex FALSE" attribute (subject to
  the caveats listed below about GLU versions).

- Fixed a problem when reading non-transparent GIFs after one with
  transparency has been read.

- Fixed a problem with more than 32 nested Transforms (can't use 
  glPushMatrix/glPopMatrix due to an implementation limit). Unfortunately,
  this slows down the code a little, at least for now.

- Binding to a viewpoint now flushes the accumulated user navigations.
  Viewpoints still don't do the jump/interpolation stuff.

- Report the integral average of the last 2 frames in the rendering
  rate display (toggled via the '/' key) to reduce the flickering.

- Display multiline/sized/justified Text (but you still need to
  compile with GLUT to render Text nodes, even in the Xt viewer).

- Fixed a compilation problem in ViewerOpenGL if you didn't have GLU1.2.

- Fixed Appearances of IndexedLineSets/PointSets (and I mean it this 
  time :).


Changes new in version 0.7.8
========================================================================

- Subclass from System to provide xmlookat with better interface (well, a
  message box and a Viewpoints menu, anyway).

- Add a load from callback function in VrmlScene to support netscape plugin
  streams.

- Better redraw event handling in Xt/Motif.

- Support for reading compressed (gzip'd) files (as long as you have PNG/ZLIB).

- Fixed egcs-1.1 problem.

- Fixed rendering of 3 point IndexedFaceSets and appearances of Lines/Points.

- Started support for non-convex geometries - Extrusions only so far and 
  you will need a version of OpenGL that supports the GLU1.2 API. Note that 
  Mesa (as of version 3.0 anyway) is at GLU1.1, but you can get 
  <A HREF="http://www.vermontel.net/~cmorley/mesa/">my updates</A> 
  to the Mesa 3.0 GLU code to bring the tesselator API up to date.


Changes new in version 0.7.7
========================================================================

- Remove use of STL stack and its associated portability problems.

- Support for IS'd Script fields.

- Fixes to set_xxx eventIns in Script nodes, MF* eventOuts in javascript.

- Stuart Anderson of Metrolink contributed a FreeBSD makefile.


Changes new in version 0.7.6
========================================================================

- Read PNG paletted grayscale images properly.


Changes new in version 0.7.5
========================================================================

- Fixes to material/texture handling. I think all but PNG paletted grayscale
  images are working properly now.

- Draw frame rate display last so it isn't obscured (duh).

- More Javascript fixes. MF* fields work better, but SFImage properties
  still can't be set after creation and array property can't be read.


Changes new in version 0.7.4
========================================================================

- Some navigation improvements: arrow keys can be used to navigate
  forward, backward, left, right; Page Up/Down cycles through viewpoints,
  Home key resets view to currently bound viewpoint settings (undoes any
  user navigation), left mouse rotates about center of the window rather 
  than the world origin.

- Viewpoints now respect the transforms above them in the scene graph so I
  could look at Greg Roelofs' (newt@pobox.com) PNG in VRML test page at 
  http://www.cdrom.com/pub/png/pngvrml.html - thanks, Greg. Greg also
  pointed out some mistakes in the texturing which will be fixed soon.

- Support for transparency and grayscale GIF textures.

- Fixed the keyboard input problem with xmlookat.

- Xt viewer will try to get less-capable visuals if a double-buffered
  RGBA with Z-buffer is not available rather than failing.

- Some OpenGL optimization (about 50% speedup for most scenes).

- Started EXTERNPROTOs, simple ones are working.


Changes new in version 0.7.3
========================================================================

- Added support for "vrmlscript:" (actually just runs javascript).

- S. K. Bose (bose@garuda.barc.ernet.in) fixed NormalInterpolators to
  interpolate on the surface of the unit sphere.

- OpenGL viewer can now be run in an Xt/Motif/Lesstif widget as an
  alternative to using the GLUT toolkit. Added xmlookat example. The
  Xt/Motif version doesn't catch keyboard input yet, and seems slow...

- GLUT version uses timeouts rather than the glut idle function, so
  lookat's CPU usage is not always 100% anymore.

- Started Text support, but not done yet (to get text, you must compile
  with -DHAVE_GLUT and link with the glut library, even if you run the
  Xt/Motif viewer). This holds true for the frame rate display, too.


Changes new in version 0.7.2
========================================================================

- Javascript browser object API completed, including createVrmlFromString, 
  createVrmlFromUrl, loadUrl, add/deleteRoute, and replaceWorld.

- Fixed an error caught by egcs in VrmlNodeScript.cpp, added a makefile
  for RedHat 5.1.


Changes new in version 0.7.1
========================================================================

- Due to popular demand, '/' (slash) key toggles frames/second display.

- Some performance improvements in the picking code.


Changes new in version 0.7
========================================================================

- More javascript API.

- Hacked in some basic http support and support for -geometry and
  -url arguments so lookat can be run under XSwallow.

- Fixed (?) OrientationInterpolator to handle axes pointing in
  opposite directions.

- Fixed texture coordinates on Spheres.

- Put example files into a separate distribution file, cleaned
  up makefiles a little more.

- The Windows port has not been updated lately, so beware...


Changes new in version 0.7-pre
========================================================================

This is a pre-release of 0.7 to make sure there are no build problems
with the new makefile. When I complete the javascript support, I'll 
make the real 0.7 release.

- Billboard, Inline, MovieTexture (GIF only so far), Script (preliminary
  javascript support), TouchSensor, and VisibilitySensor nodes.

- Preliminary javascript: support in Script nodes. No SF*/MF* objects
  are available yet.

- Fixed TimeSensor start conditions.

- Fixed reversed indexing, generate normals on ElevationGrids.

- Added generation of normals (per face only) and fixed texture coordinates
  for IndexedFaceSets.

- Fixed Cone normals (again).

- Fixed IndexedFaceSet color/texture problem.

- Removed virtual inline functions to reduce object sizes and speed
  up compilations.

- Fixed some parser problems including "#viewpoint" URL parsing. 
  Thanks to Shelby Moore (support@3Dize.com), CTO 3Dize, for comments, 
  critiques, and suggestions for improving the lexing/parsing and 
  field/node management code.

- Defined classes for the remaining nodes so the standardNodes.wrl file
  is no longer necessary. The drag sensors and sound/audioclip classes
  don't actually do anything, though.

- Fixed problems with avatarSize 0 (thanks to Steve Sycamore for locating
  this problem).

- Simplified the makefile so porting should be less hazardous.

- Included a subdirectory (wrl) containing some sample files testing
  the new features.
