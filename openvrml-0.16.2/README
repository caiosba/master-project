About
=====

   OpenVRML is a portable toolkit including a C++ library for reading
and displaying VRML and X3D files, an OpenGL renderer, and a Mozilla
Web browser plug-in for viewing VRML and X3D content on the Internet.


License terms
=============

   The OpenVRML libraries comprising the VRML/X3D runtime ("libopenvrml")
and the OpenGL renderer ("libopenvrml-gl") are available under the terms
of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), version 2.1.  These
libraries incorporate some code that is available under "LGPL-
compatible" licenses, which effectively means that the OpenVRML
libraries are Free Software which may be used collectively according to
the terms of the LGPL.  The full text of the LGPL can be found in the
file "COPYING.LESSER".  Code used in these libararies under other terms
(and available for reuse under the same terms) is as follows:

 * OpenVRML uses the ANTLR parser generator and C++ support library
   which are in the public domain.

 * OpenVRML's OpenGL renderer includes code from Silicon Graphics, Inc.:

Prerequisites
=============

   OpenVRML requires the Boost C++ libraries to build.  Boost is
packaged for many systems; so you should consult your operating system
vendor if Boost is not already installed on your system.  Otherwise, you
can obtain Boost from <http://boost.org>.

   Note that Boost binaries built from the boost.org distribution, as
well as some other distributions, apply a suffix to the library
name that depends on the particular build configuration.  When
building OpenVRML with such binaries it will be necessary to set the
variable BOOST_LIB_SUFFIX to match the suffix applied to the Boost
binaries; refer to the output of "configure --help".

   Building OpenVRML is fairly demanding of system resources.  It is
recommended that build hosts have at least 768 MB of system memory.


Optional dependencies
=====================

   OpenVRML has several optional dependencies.  If your system is
missing any of these dependencies, first check to see if they are
provided by your operating system vendor.  If not, consult the URIs
below.

     libpng                 <http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html>
     libjpeg                <http://www.ijg.org>
     FreeType               <http://freetype.org>
     Fontconfig             <http://fontconfig.org>
     Mozilla                <http://mozilla.org>
     Java Development Kit   <http://java.sun.com/j2se/>
     OpenGL/Mesa            <http://mesa3d.org>
     GTK+                   <http://gtk.org>
     SDL                    <http://libsdl.org>
     Doxygen                <http://doxygen.org>

   OpenVRML can be built with reduced functionality which can avoid
these dependencies.  See the following section, "'configure' options",
for details.


"configure" options
===================

   OpenVRML's build configuration script accepts a number of arguments
that modify what features are built and/or what packages OpenVRML
depends on.

 --disable-exception-specs
     Disable use of C++ exception specifications.  This is likely to
     improve performance.  Note that this changes the library ABI.

 --disable-png-textures
     Disable support for rendering PNG images as textures.  OpenVRML
     uses libpng to read PNG images.

 --disable-jpeg-textures
     Disable support for rendering JPEG images as textures.  OpenVRML
     uses libjpeg to read JPEG images.

 --disable-render-text-node
     Disable support for rendering Text nodes.  The node is still
     parsed, and events to and from it are processed; but no text is
     rendered.  By default OpenVRML uses Fontconfig for font discovery
     and FreeType to get font data.

 --disable-script-node-javascript
     Disable support for JavaScript in the Script node.  By default,
     OpenVRML uses the Mozilla JavaScript library to execute JavaScript.

 --enable-script-node-java
     Enable support for Java in the Script node.  "configure" searches
     for a Java Native Interface (JNI) implementation, which may be
     provided either by a Java Development Kit or the GNU Compiler for
     Java (gcj).  If using a Java Development Kit, you will probably
     need to supply the include and library directories using CPPFLAGS
     and LDFLAGS, respectively.  See the file INSTALL for general
     information on using these variables.

     NOTE: This option is not supported in this release of OpenVRML.
     (Don't even bother trying; the code simply does not build.) Java
     scripting support will reappear in a future release of OpenVRML.

 --disable-gl-renderer
     Do not build the GL renderer.  OpenVRML's GL renderer depends on
     OpenGL/Mesa.

 --disable-gtkplug
     Do not build the GtkPlug application.  This is an out-of-process
     component that provides a VRML/X3D browser that can be used in a
     GTK+ application.  This depends on GTK+.  It also requires that the
     GL renderer be built.

 --disable-mozilla-plugin
     Do not build the Mozilla plug-in.  The Mozilla plug-in depends on
     GTK+ and, of course, Mozilla.  It also requires that the GtkPlug
     application be built.

 --disable-examples
     Do not build the example programs.  The example programs depend on
     SDL.

 --with-x
     Passing the argument "--without-x" to "configure" will allow
     OpenVRML to be built without depending on the X Windowing System.
     This option is really only useful when building OpenVRML on
     platforms where X is available alongside another windowing system
     (e.g., Cygwin or Mac OS X with X installed).

 --with-apple-opengl-framework
     Use Apple's OpenGL framework on Mac OS X.


Significant preprocessor symbols
================================

   Certain code in OpenVRML is compiled conditionally depending on what
symbols have been defined for the preprocessor.  The "configure" script
will add the appropriate compiler and preprocessor flags for you; in
general you should use the options to "configure" documented in the
previous section rather than define these symbols in CPPFLAGS.  These
symbols are documented here primarily for the benefit of persons trying
to compile OpenVRML without the GNU build tools.

 OPENVRML_ENABLE_PNG_TEXTURES
     Include support for rendering PNG images as textures.  Requires
     libpng.

 OPENVRML_ENABLE_JPEG_TEXTURES
     Include support for rendering JPEG images as textures.  Requires
     libjpeg.

 OPENVRML_ENABLE_RENDER_TEXT_NODE
     Include support for rendering text using the Text node.  Requires
     fontconfig and FreeType.

 OPENVRML_ENABLE_SCRIPT_NODE_JAVASCRIPT
     Include support for JavaScript scripts in the Script node.
     Requires Mozilla SpiderMonkey.

 OPENVRML_ENABLE_SCRIPT_NODE_JAVA
     Include support for Java scripts in the Script node.  Requires the
     Sun Java Development Kit.

 HAVE_APPLE_OPENGL_FRAMEWORK
     Use Apple's OpenGL framework.  Mac OS X only.


Installation
============

   Refer to the file "INSTALL" for detailed installation instructions.


Usage
=====

   To write programs that use the OpenVRML libraries, refer to the API
documentation in the "doc/manual" subdirectory of the distribution and
the example programs in the "examples" subdirectory.

   If OpenVRML is configured to be installed to the same prefix as a
Mozilla-based browser is installed on the system, "make install" will
install the Mozilla plug-in to the browser's plug-in directory.  This
should be sufficient to enable support for the "model/vrml" media type
in the browser.  Entering "about:plugins" in the URL entry bar of a
Mozilla-based browser will show a listing of successfully installed
plug-ins.

   It is possible, for testing or other convenience, to run the
plug-in from the build directories.  A symbolic link to the plug-in
module "openvrml.so" must be made in the Mozilla plug-in directory and
the environment variable "OPENVRML_GTKPLUG" must be set to the full
path name of the "openvrml-gtkplug" executable.


Conformance
===========

   OpenVRML aspires to full conformance to the VRML97 specification. It
isn't there yet, but much of the spec is supported, and OpenVRML will
continue to get better.


Bug reports
===========

   Please report any bugs you encounter via the SourceForge bug tracking
system:

     <http://sf.net/bugs/?group_id=7151>

   Note that you will need to log into SourceForge before reporting a
bug.


Mailing lists
=============

   Two mailing lists are maintained:

 * <openvrml-announce@lists.sourceforge.net> is a low-traffic list for
   announcments, typically regarding new releases.  Subscription
   instructions are at
     <http://lists.sf.net/mailman/listinfo/openvrml-announce>

 * <openvrml-develop@lists.sourceforge.net> is a forum for developers using
   and working on the libraries.  User feedback is welcome in this
   channel.  Subscription instructions are at
     <http://lists.sf.net/mailman/listinfo/openvrml-develop>

      In order to curb unsolicited commercial e-mail, openvrml-develop
   permits posting only by subscribers.

Get involved
============

   We're always grateful for help in improving OpenVRML.  Consult the
SourceForge Task Manager for a list of planned improvements:

     <http://sf.net/pm/task.php?group_project_id=2579&group_id=7151&func=browse>

   Unassigned tasks are up for grabs, but please post to the
openvrml-develop mailing list to alert others of your intention to take
a task.  This helps avoid duplicated effort.  If you do not see the task
you'd like to pursue listed in the Task Manager, but you think the
library could benefit from your contribution, post a proposal to the
openvrml-develop mailing list.
