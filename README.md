This is my master project on Computer Science at Federal University of Bahia - Brazil.

This repository is organized the following way:

* misc: codes not directly related to the project... includes testing code, related stuff and so on.
* src: the project code
* old: old stuff, not used anymore (like VRML, ARToolKit, etc.)
